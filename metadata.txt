qgisMinimumVersion=3.6
description=Cluster Points conducts spatial clustering of points based on their mutual distance to each other. The user can select between the K-Means algorithm and (agglomerative) hierarchical clustering with several different link functions. In addition to the geographical coordinates, one numerical field can now be incorporated into the clustering as well.

about=Sometimes it is requisite to determine distinct groups of points on a map which are closest to each other. To automatize this process, Cluster Points allows you to find a predefined number of groups with mutually close points. <br><br>Different cluster algorithms are provided in this comprehensive GIS implementation. The user may choose from the K-Means algorithm, hierarchical clustering with SLINK or hierarchical clustering with the Lance-Williams distance updates together with a cluster feature preprocessing (similar to BIRCH). Also, the user may prescribe one numerical field which can be incorporated into the spatial clustering by a prescribed percentage. This plugin was started during the project phase of a GIS-Analyst training course in Berlin (https://gis-trainer.de).
