description: <br>Cluster Points conducts spatial clustering of points based on their mutual distance to each other. The user can select between the K-Means algorithm and (agglomerative) hierarchical clustering with several different link functions. 

about=<br><br><br>Sometimes it is requisite to determine distinct groups of points on a map which are closest to each other. To automatize this process, Cluster Points allows you to find a predefined number of groups with mutually close points. <br><br>The cluster algorithms are well-known, but until now there has not been an implementation for a GIS system, yet.<br><br> This plugin was started during the project phase of a GIS-Analyst training course in Berlin (Geo-sys).
